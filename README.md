# Codility
With this repository I'm securing and sharing my solutions for the codility lessons. I aim to score 100% for each lesson. I also try to document my thought process and why I chose the approach as well as possible.  If you think there is a better solution, feel free to contact me or create a new issue. If you have questions please contact me. I love explaining, so I welcome every question regarding the code.     
Please refer to the WIKI for the documentation on the lessons.
